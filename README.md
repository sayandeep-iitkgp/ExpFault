# ExpFault
This is a proof-of-concept implementation of the ExpFault Tool from our CHES 2018 paper.
"Saha, S., Mukhopadhyay, D., & Dasgupta, P. (2018). ExpFault: An Automated Framework for Exploitable Fault Characterization in Block Ciphers. IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, 2018(2), 242â€“276. https://doi.org/10.13154/tches.v2018.i2.242-276"

This version of the tool has been tested on Google Colab and is meant for demonstration purposes.
It should also run on platforms supporting python => 3.5.

Dependencies:
Please see "DFATool_Colab_v3/doc/DEPENDENCIES"
